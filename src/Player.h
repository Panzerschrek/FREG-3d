/** \class Player Player.h
 * \brief This class contains information specific to player
 * and interface for manipulating him.
 *
 * It receives input from screen, processes it, and dispatches
 * actions to world.
 *
 * It loads player from file and saves him to it.
 *
 * Note: player block with its inventory is stored it shred
 * file with all other blocks. player_save contains only
 * coordinates where player is, his home coordinates and world
 * player belongs to.
 *
 * Also it does checks for player walking over the shred border.
